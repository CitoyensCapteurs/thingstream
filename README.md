ThingStream Source Tree
===========

ThingStream is a free, open-source & open-data IoT datastore running on top of OpenTSDB (http://opentsdb.net).
The ThingStream Django app is effectively a webified API with authentication and ownership of streams for the OpenTSDB backend.  

The ThingStream source tree includes:
* The web/ directory with all the django files to run the API.
* The lib/ directory with a simple python library to post to ThingStream
* The clients/ directory with some sample clients for various uses.

ThingStream is an initiative of LaboCitoyen, a French non-profit working on Citizen-Centered scientific projects.
